# boxcustodia-workflow-next

A landing page I made for a client as a freelancer, precisely following the provided design.

The project uses Next.js, Bootstrap and styled-components, along with some helper libraries. For tooling, it uses TypeScript, ESLint with several plugins and Prettier.

The website obtains an excellent [score](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fboxcustodia-sello-competencia.vercel.app%2F&form_factor=mobile) in Lighthouse, easily passing all tests.
